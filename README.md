### Step 1
 - bag of words model (words as features). 
 
 **Run 1** - Prof's arff file raw. No stemming, no stop word removal  
 **Run 2** - Our generated arff file with stemming (Porter's) and stop word removal (?). Same as prof's file but with stop word removal and stemming  
 **Run 3** - Prof's file with tf-idf (more wight on rare words), stemming  (lovins?), stop word removal (?).  
 **Run 4** - Our genereated arff file with tf-idf (more wight on rare words), stemming (Porter's stemmer) and stop word removal  
 
 **Need to report accuracy, confusion matrices, precision, recall and f-measures**
